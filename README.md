Getting and Cleaning Data Project Store
======================
This is the Project Store for Getting and Cleaning Data Module.

The repo contains the script that will read the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"" from the Internet and summarises all the mean and std features for each subject and each activity who participated in the experiment to output it into a text file name tidy_data.txt.

Please refer to the CodeBook.md for more details (e.g. Data Sources and Transformations) on the run_analysis.R script.

Please note that the script <b>will</b> require internet connection in order to work.
